    "In this jupyter notebook, we will learn how to perform a round of self-calibration using killMS & DDFacet on a LOFAR dataset. All the required software will be pre-installed on the singularity you'll be using for the school, and the data you will work on will be provided alongside it. If you want to do this later on your own machine and in your own time, you must first have the following installed (non-exhaustive list, I probably forgot at least one thing):\n",

    "taking care to follow the instructions in individual gits where appropriate. Note that all the installs recommended here only work after installing KERN. If you don't want to use KERN, that is fine! Just be prepared for a good week of tears and sorrow. Note that KERN also comes with a lot of other useful radio-astro tools; I personally recommend tigger as an image viewer (takes a while to get used to but has some very useful functions) and pybdsf if you wish to get deeper than this tutorial in interferometric imaging.\n",

    "Having made our model, we'll now proceed to calibration. First, a quick reminder of what calibration is, as opposed to imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging consists of taking a set of visibilities, mapping them onto the image-plane using a Fast Fourier Transform (thus creating a so-called \"dirty image\"), and then using some kind of deconvolution algorithm to create a \"restored\" image, in which the impact of the PSF (which is huge for interferometric arrays, as they tend to sample the uv-plane very sparsely) is mitigated as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration is usually a bit more difficult to wrap one's head around. To understand it, we must go back to the notion of the visibility and what it is an antenna measures. An antenna measures a voltage proportional to the strength of the incoming waves in the electromagnetic field (i.e. light) within its detection band. It is this voltage which is measured by single-dish antennas. A visibility is the correlation between the voltages recorded by two antennas at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the voltage measured by an antenna is assumed to be proportional to the radio signal sent by astronomical source. The proportionality factor between sky signal and antenna voltage is called the _gain_, and interferometry relies on the hypothesis that visibility gains can be decoupled into antenna gains. Calibration then consists of solving for the gain of all your antennas at all times and frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "KillMS, then, is the software used in the Wirtinger pack to solve for antenna gains. These can be direction-independent or direction-dependent - that is set by the number given in the NCluster parameter in MakeModel. Let's, once again, look at the options in killMS:"

Now we simply have to let DDFacet know which set of gains to read in when mapping the visibilities to the sky, and we're done with one round of selfcal! Note that, depending on your choice of calibration parameters, it is possible that your final DD-calibrated image may actually have regions (facets or groups of facets) which are worse than the original. In truly abhorrent cases, your entire image could be worse! When this happens, it usually means that there's a problem with your calibration. Check that you're using the correct sky model, that you're not making mistakes with the beam (use it in both calibration & imaging the same way, or don't use it at all), that your runs didn't crash or the computer goblins didn't mess with your data...\n",
